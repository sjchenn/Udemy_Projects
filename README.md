### EmotionAI

Build two CNNs with ResNet to prevent vanishing gradient problems. The first model `model_1_facialKeyPoints` predicts locations of important features such as eye brows from images. The second model `model_2_emotion` classifies five different emotions from images. Models are deployed on tensor flow server.
